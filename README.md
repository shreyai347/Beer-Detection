# Beer-Detection
This project uses the YOLOv11 model for real-time object detection to identify beer bottles in images. With pre-trained weights, it detects and annotates beer bottles 🍺, drawing bounding boxes around them. You can train the model on custom datasets, run inference on images, and save the results with annotated outputs.
